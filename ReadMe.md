### Linear Correlation
- Examined the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
- Found strong positive correlation between total bill and tip.
- Detected moderate correlation between party size and both total bill and tip.
- Noted some multicollinearity among input features, justifying the use of PCA.

 

### What the Code Does and the Steps
- Loads and preprocesses the tips dataset.
- Applies log transformation to reduce skew in total bill and tip.
- Engineers new features, including tip percent and polynomial interactions.
- One-hot encodes categorical variables for model compatibility.
- Splits data into train, validation, and test sets.
- Standardizes features for fair model comparison.
- Runs two experiments: one with original features, one with PCA-transformed features.
- Trains and evaluates Linear Regression and Neural Network models on both feature sets.
- Visualizes results with bar charts, scatter plots, and pairplots.

 

### What the Graphs Mean
- Correlation matrix heatmap shows strength and direction of relationships between variables.
- Pairplot visualizes pairwise relationships and distributions, colored by party size.
- Model comparison bar chart displays MAE for each model and feature set.
- Predicted vs. actual scatter plots show how closely model predictions match real values.
- Actual vs. predicted line plot highlights differences between predicted and actual total bills for each test sample.
- PCA scree plot illustrates how much variance is explained by each principal component.

 

### How the Different Models Work and Differ
- Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between features and target; interpretable and fast.
- Neural Network (MLP) can model complex, non-linear relationships; requires more data and tuning.
- PCA reduces dimensionality and multicollinearity by transforming features into uncorrelated principal components.
- Linear Regression and Neural Network are both trained on original and PCA-transformed data for comparison.
- Linear Regression is more interpretable; Neural Network may capture more complex patterns if present.

 

### Explaining the Results and Which Model is Best
- Linear Regression on original features typically achieves lower MAE than Neural Network.
- PCA-transformed models sometimes perform similarly or slightly worse, depending on information loss.
- Neural Network does not outperform Linear Regression, likely due to dataset size and the nature of the data.
- Best model: Linear Regression (Original or PCA), as it provides the lowest MAE and is robust for this dataset.
- Recommendation: Use Linear Regression with original or PCA features for tip prediction; consider Neural Network only with more data or more complex relationships.

Absolutely! Here’s an expanded, bullet-point explanation of each graph, what the data means, and what the graphs reveal about the data and model performance:

 

### Correlation Matrix Heatmap
- **What it is:**  
  - A color-coded matrix showing the correlation coefficients between every pair of features.
- **What the data means:**  
  - Values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative relationships; values near 0 indicate weak or no relationship.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - Strong positive correlation between `total_bill` and `tip` suggests that as the bill increases, the tip tends to increase as well.
  - Moderate correlation between `size` and both `total_bill` and `tip` indicates larger parties tend to have higher bills and tips.
  - Some features (e.g., categorical variables) show little to no correlation, suggesting limited direct influence.
  - Multicollinearity is present, justifying the use of PCA to reduce redundancy.

 

### Pairplot (Colored by Party Size)
- **What it is:**  
  - A grid of scatter plots and histograms showing pairwise relationships and distributions for key features, with points colored by party size.
- **What the data means:**  
  - Each scatter plot shows how two variables relate; diagonal plots show the distribution of each variable.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - Clear positive trend between `total_bill` and `tip` across all party sizes.
  - Distribution plots show that both `total_bill` and `tip` are right-skewed (most values are low, with a few high outliers).
  - Larger party sizes cluster at higher total bills and tips, confirming their influence.
  - Some overlap between party sizes, but larger groups generally spend and tip more.

 

### PCA Scree Plot
- **What it is:**  
  - A line plot showing the cumulative explained variance as more principal components are included.
- **What the data means:**  
  - Each point represents the total variance explained by the first N principal components.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - The curve rises quickly and then levels off, indicating that a small number of components capture most of the variance.
  - Justifies the choice of how many components to keep (e.g., enough to explain ≥80% of the variance).
  - Confirms that dimensionality reduction is possible without losing much information.

 

### Model Comparison Bar Chart (MAE)
- **What it is:**  
  - A bar chart comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of each model and feature set.
- **What the data means:**  
  - Lower MAE means more accurate predictions.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - Linear Regression (Original) typically has the lowest MAE, indicating best performance.
  - Neural Network models have higher MAE, suggesting they are less accurate for this dataset.
  - PCA models may perform similarly or slightly worse, depending on information loss.
  - Visualizes the clear ranking of model performance for easy comparison.

 

### Predicted vs. Actual Scatter Plots
- **What it is:**  
  - Scatter plots where each point represents a test sample, with actual total bill on the x-axis and predicted total bill on the y-axis.
  - The red dashed line represents perfect predictions (Ideal).
- **What the data means:**  
  - Points close to the line indicate accurate predictions; points far from the line indicate errors.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - Linear Regression predictions cluster closely around the ideal line, showing good accuracy.
  - Neural Network predictions are more scattered, indicating less reliable predictions.
  - PCA models may show slightly more spread, reflecting some loss of information.
  - Outliers or systematic deviations from the line may indicate model bias or areas for improvement.

 

### Actual vs. Predicted Line Plot (for PCA Models)
- **What it is:**  
  - A line plot showing actual total bill and predicted total bill (from both models) for each test sample, sorted by actual value.
- **What the data means:**  
  - Allows direct visual comparison of how well each model tracks the true values across the range of the data.
- **What the graph reveals:**  
  - If predicted lines closely follow the actual line, the model is accurate.
  - Gaps between lines highlight where models over- or under-predict.
  - Makes it easy to spot systematic errors or areas where one model outperforms the other.

 

**Summary:**  
- The graphs collectively show that total bill and tip are strongly related, party size matters, and that Linear Regression (especially on original features) is the most accurate model for this dataset.
- PCA can reduce dimensionality with little loss of information, but may not always improve model accuracy.
- Visualizations make it clear where models succeed and where they struggle, guiding future improvements.


## **Introduction**

- Predicting restaurant tips is a valuable yet challenging task for the hospitality industry, as it can inform staffing, service strategies, and revenue forecasting.
- The relationship between the tip amount and available features—such as total bill, party size, day, time, and customer demographics—is complex and potentially non-linear.
- This project aims to develop and compare machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and Neural Networks, to accurately predict tip amounts using both original and PCA-transformed features.
- By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we seek to identify the most effective approach for tip prediction and provide actionable insights for restaurant management.



## **Conclusion**

- Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison, we found that Linear Regression using original features consistently outperformed Neural Networks and PCA-based models in predicting restaurant tips.
- The analysis revealed strong linear relationships between total bill, tip, and party size, justifying the effectiveness of simpler models for this dataset.
- While PCA successfully reduced dimensionality and addressed multicollinearity, it did not significantly improve predictive accuracy.
- Visualizations such as correlation matrices, pairplots, and predicted vs. actual plots provided clear evidence of model performance and data relationships.
- For this dataset, we recommend using Linear Regression with original features for tip prediction. Future improvements could include collecting more granular data (e.g., menu items, server ID, time of year) and exploring advanced ensemble methods or deep learning with larger datasets.
